# This corrected code correctly subsets a data frame using a character vector
# containing column names.  It uses a logical vector to select the correct columns.

df <- data.frame(A = 1:3, B = 4:6, C = 7:9)
cols <- c("A", "B", "C")

# Correct subsetting
correct_subset_df <- df[, colnames(df) %in% cols]

#Alternative correct subsetting (using subset function)
correct_subset_df2 <- subset(df, select = cols)

# Print the results
print(correct_subset_df)
