```r
# This code attempts to subset a data frame using a character vector
# containing column names, but it produces an unexpected error.

df <- data.frame(A = 1:3, B = 4:6, C = 7:9)
cols <- c("A", "B", "C")

# Incorrect subsetting
subset_df <- df[, cols]

#The problem lies in the way R handles subsetting with character vectors.  When you use [, cols], R expects cols to be a numeric vector of column indices, not a character vector of column names.

#Correct subsetting
correct_subset_df <- df[, colnames(df) %in% cols]
